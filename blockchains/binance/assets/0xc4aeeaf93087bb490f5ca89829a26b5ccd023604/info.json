    "description": "FME token used in the FamiChain Network can be used as FamiChain Exchanges (CEX) native token. We have created a new L2 token that reduces network congestion (causes gas fees to skyrocket) and is close to the speed of Bitcoin Lightning Network. This is a project that makes it easier and more economical to transmit and interact with transactions and smart contracts on multi-chains.",
